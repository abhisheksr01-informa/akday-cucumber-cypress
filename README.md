## Pre-requisites

This project uses node.js. At the time of writing, I am using node.js 16.10.0 although anything 14+ will probably work.

You can install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/

## Development

### Start by launching the server

`npm start`

### Run tests (requires server running)

In a visible browser: `npm run test:dev`

_or_ in headless mode: `npm test`
